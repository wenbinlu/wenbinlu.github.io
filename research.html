      <h3> Fast Radio Bursts </h3>

      <ul>
	<li> Emission Mechanism  </li>

	<p> In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.1397L/abstract">
          Lu, Kumar & Zhang (2020)</a>,
        we propose that FRBs are generated by Alfven waves
        propagating in the neutron star (NS) magnetosphere to large distances where they
        become charge starved, and charge clumps are accelerated by an electric field
        and coherently generate curvature emission in the radio band.
      </p>

      <p>
        The figure to the right shows Alfven waves launched from the magnetic
	foot points propagate along the
        field lines to distances much larger than the NS radius where the charge
        density is too low to sustain the current associated with the wave.
        As a result of charge starvation, a strong electric field component
        parallel to the background B-field develops, and charge clumps are
        accelerated to high Lorentz factors and coherently produce curvature
        emission in the radio band. The FRB emission is beamed into
        the solid angle spanned by the orange arrow. The Alfven waves launched far
        from the poles are trapped by field lines that do not extend to
	sufficiently large distances,
        and a pair fireball is formed which emits hard X-rays visible from a large fraction
        of the sky. This model provides a unified picture for faint bursts like FRB 200428
	(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020Natur.587...59B/abstract">Bochenek et al. 2020</a>,
	<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020Natur.587...54C/abstract">CHIME Collaboration 2020</a>)
        as well as the bright bursts seen at cosmological distances.
      </p>
	
	
	<li> Source Objects </li>

	<img src="./files/PPdotlims.png" align="right" width="400" height="300">
	
	<p> In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.1867L/abstract">
            Lu, Beniamini & Kumar (2022)</a>,
	  we propose that the FRB source in a globular cluster of M81
	  (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Natur.602..585K/abstract">Kirsten et al. 2022</a>) is
	  a NS with strong B-fields > 10^13 G (likely at the level of magnetars).
	</p>

	<p> The figure to the right shows the joint constraints on the P (spin period) and Pdot (period derivative)
	  of the M81-FRB source object, based on (i) the non-detection of X-rays by Chandra,
	  (ii) the age limit (> 10^4 yr, from the event rate), and (iii) the requirement of a magnetic energy reservoir.
	  The white region is allowed by observations --- the source object is magnetar-like, but somewhat older than
	  Galactic magnetars with an age of ~10^5 yrs. It is still unknown how the old (~10 Gyr) stellar population in the
	  globular cluster can produce such a magnetar-like object. A likely channel is the merger of two massive (~1 Msun)
	  white dwarfs, which did not generate a type-Ia supernova but the merger remnant collapses into
	  a strongly magnetized NS.
	</p>

	<li> Polarization </li>
	<img src="./files/dipole_field.pdf" align="right" width="300" height="212">
	<p>
	  In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483..359L/abstract">
	    Lu, Kumar & Narayan (2019)</a>, we study the propagation of FRB waves
	  through the magnetosphere of a strongly magnetized NS. It is shown that
	  the observed electric (polarization) vector is determined by the B-field
	  orientation at the polarization-limiting radius located far from the NS
	  surface where the dipolar field dominates (as shown in the right figure),
	  independent of magnetic configuration of the emission region which is much
	  closer by. This is because, as the waves propagate in an inhomogeneous plasma,
	  the electric vector undergoes adiabatic walking, which keeps its X-mode eigenmode nature
	  --- the E-field stays perpendicular to the k-B plane (k and B are the wavevector
	  and background B-field).
	  Therefore, the polarization angles of repeating bursts should be
	  periodic as modulated by the NS spin, even if the burst
	  occurrence may not be periodic. Such a periodicity should show up once
	  we have a sufficient number of bright bursts from a given repeater.

      <h3> Tidal Disruption Events </h3>
      <img src="./files/TDE_faceon.png" align="right" width="300" height="310">
      <p>
	Main-sequence stars are shredded by tidal forces when they get sufficiently close
	to a supermassive black hole (BH). After disruption, the star is stretched into
	a long thin stream (of aspect ratio ~1000) in highly eccentric orbits (1-e ~ 0.01)
	which undergo general relativistic precession. Such precession causes the stream to
	self-intersect. Then, the shocked gas expanding from the intersection point will
	eventually form an accretion disk, which powers multi-wavelength emission. A few
	dozen of these tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates have been found in recent
	surveys designed to find variable sources in the optical/UV and soft X-rays.
      </p>

      <p>
	Global numerical simulation of the hydrodynamic evolution of the thin fallback
	stream is prohibitively expensive.
	In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492..686L/abstract">
	  Lu & Bonnerot (2020)</a>, we made a key
	simplification of the problem by first calculating the location where the
	stream self-intersects according to general relativistic geodesic motion and
	then performing hydrodynamic simulations of the stream collision process in a
	local region near the intersection point. We found that the self-crossing shock
	redistributes energy and angular momentum of the gas in the fall-back stream.
	For sufficiently deeply penetrating orbits (pericenter radius Rp <~ 15Rg), the shocks at the
	intersection are able to unbind a large fraction (up to 50%) of the fallback gas.
	We call the unbound gas the “collision-induced outflow” or CIO. We found that the CIO
	covers a large fraction of the sky viewed from the BH and is able to reprocess the hard
	(EUV/soft X-ray) photons from the disk into the optical band. This provides an
	explanation of the bright optical emission seen in many TDEs. Viewing angle effects
	then cause the X-ray luminosity to vary by orders of magnitude from one event to another.

	In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.4885B/abstract">
	  Bonnerot, Lu & Hopkins (2021)</a>, we conduct the first radiation hydrodynamics
	simulation of a realistic TDE (a 0.5Msun main-sequence star disrupted by a 2.5x10^6 Msun BH),
	using the code <a href="http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html">GIZMO</a>.
	The multi-panel figure to the right shows the time evolution of the radiation
	temperature defined based on the local radiation energy density (U_rad = a T_r^4)
	inside the equatorial plane. The time unit is t_{min} = 40d --- the minimum period
	of the bound stellar debris. In the t=0 panel (and all others), the BH is represented by a
	white circle in the lower half of the figure, and the circle above that is the position of the self-crossing
	shock where we inject gas into the computational domain. We found rapid formation of an
	accretion disk after the onset of stream self-crossing. Moreover, the region near the
	self-crossing point has very little
	radiation as a result of strong shielding, so the gas there can maintain a low
	ionization fraction and hence high opacity --- this provides the necessary ingredients
	for reprocessing of EUV/X-ray photons into the optical band.

      <h3> Formation of GW190814 (most likely a BBH merger) </h3>

      <img src="./files/gw190814.pdf" align="right" width="400" height="380">
      
      <p style="margin-bottom:3cm;">
	The LIGO-Virgo Collaboration recently reported a puzzling event, GW190814,
	with component masses of 23 and 2.6 Msun --- a surprising mass ratio of q ~ 0.1. In
	<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500.1817L/abstract">
	Lu, Beniamini & Bonnerot (2021)</a>,
	we propose a 2nd-generation merger scenario where the 2.6Msun object
	was from a previous binary neutron star (BNS) coalescence and the remnant
	was able to merge again with the 23 Msun BH tertiary. This occurs when the
	remnant (most likely a low-mass BH) receives a kick of about 100 km/s in the
	direction of the "loss cone" shaped like a flying saucer, as shown in the figure
	to the right. This model was motivated by the relatively small rate (1 to 23  per Gpc^3
	per yr) inferred from GW190814 and the secondary mass being close to the total
	masses of known BNS systems. We show that about 1% of the BNS coalescence occurring
	in triple systems should give rise to 2nd-generation mergers, provided that a massive
	BH tertiary is located at a separation less than a few AU. Since the total BNS
	coalescence rate is of the order 10^3 per Gpc^3 per yr, this model requires that
	at least 10% BNS mergers occur in triple systems. Since the typical delay time
	for the 2nd-generation merger is about a Hubble time, these BNS mergers in triples
	occurred in the distant past when the Universe was less metal-enriched. Low-metallicity
	(< 0.1 solar) is also favored for the formation of the 23 Msun BH.
	This model has a number of testable predictions, one of which is that the secondary of
	GW190814-like events should have dimensionless spin of about 0.7.
	The other one is that future extreme mass-ratio (q ~ 0.1) events should also have
	seconary mass in the narrow range of 2.5 to 2.8 Msun (based on Galactic BNS systems).

      <h3> Neutron Star Mergers and Gamma-Ray Bursts </h3>

      <p>
      The overall picture of GW170817/AT2017gfo, as inferred from its
      gravitational wave (GW) emission, gamma-ray flash, kilonova, and broadband
      afterglow from a relativistic off-axis jet, confirmed the conjecture
      that neutron star (NS) mergers are a significant contributor
      to the r-process nucleosynthesis as well as the sources of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).
      </p>

      <img src="./files/bNS_disk_sketch.png" align="right" width="400" height="320" >
      
      <p>
      In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220804293L/exportcitation">Lu & Quataert (2022)</a>,
      we study the long-term (>> 10 sec) evolution of the accretion disk in NS mergers (previous
      works focused on short-term evolution within the first few seconds). It is shown that the
      radioactive heating by r-process nuclei eventually exceeds the disk's binding energy
	roughly 10^2 sec after the merger. This causes the disk to rapidly evaporate leaving nothing behind.
	  The figure to the right schematically shows the evolution of the disk mass with time since merger. At t ~ 1 sec,
	  the disk loses most of its mass due to nuclear recombination forming alpha-particles. At t ~ 10^2 sec, radioactive
	  decay causes another episode of mass loss from the disk.
      </p>

      <p>
	We suggest that the extended emission (EE) observed in many short GRBs is powered by
	late-time disk accretion and that the steep flux decline seen at the end of the EE is due to rapid disk
	evaporation (which shuts off the jet).
      </p>

      <img src="./files/bNS_2jets.png" align="right" width="400" height="400" >
      
      <p>
	We also suggest that the jets from NS mergers have two components ---
	a short-duration narrow one corresponding to the prompt gamma-ray emission
	and a long-lasting wide component producing the EE. Observers at different viewing angles
	(marked by 1, 2, 3 in the figure to the right) would see different phenomena.
	This leads to a prediction that "orphan EE"
	(without the prompt gamma-rays, from viewing angle "2") may be a promising
	electromagnetic counterpart
	for NS mergers observable by future wide-field X-ray surveys.
      </p>

      <p>
	The long-lived disk produces a slow ejecta component (~0.01 c). We predict that future JWST near-IR
	spectroscopy of nearby (<~ 100 Mpc) NS mergers will detect narrow line features a few weeks after the merger,
	which provides a powerful probe of the atomic species formed in these events.
