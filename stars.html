	Stellar Physics (ASTRON 160, 24Fall[undergrad])
      </h1>

      <h3>
	General Info:
      </h3>
      <ul>
	<li> Goal of the class: Satrs play a central role in astrophysics. They contain most of the luminous matter in the universe, synthesize most elements on the periodic table, produce exotic compact objects, and are laboratories for astrophysicists. Any student who is interested in astronomy will encounter stellar physics to various degrees. This course will cover the stellar structure, energy transport, nuclear fusion, various phenomenology related to stellar evolution, and compact remnants as the evolutionary endpoints.
	<li> Prerequisite: None (the course is self-contained), but we will make significant use of statistical mechanics, fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetism.
	<li> Required texts: A. C. Phillips (1993), D. Prialnik (2011), O. R. Pols (2011) </li>
	<li> Grading:
	  <p>
	    Homework 50%; Midterm exam 20%; Final exam 20%; Project Report 10%
